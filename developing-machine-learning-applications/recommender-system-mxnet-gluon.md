## Concepts

- Collaborative Filtering
  - **user based recommenders**: try to identify other _users_ that are similar to you and see what they have bought
  - **item based recommenders**: try to identify other _items_ that are similar to what _you_ have bought
  - both work by taking existing ratings and trying to predict how you would rate them
  - millions of users/products, and few rankings: very sparse matrix
- Matrix Factorization
  - factorizes a larger, sparse matrix to 2 separate matrices (one tall, one wide) that when multiplied approximate the original
  - still reaches memory limits when you hit millions of records
- Embedding Layer
  - network extracts the importance of features from the data
  - often used in NLP, for example to classify `positive`, `happy`, and `radiant` as similar meaning
    - can be generated by parts of speech, types of nouns (locations, foods, etc)
